		<description><![CDATA[I guess, but I like the idea of laying down some real tracks on my lunch-break, or when on vacation. That&#039;s where something like the Tascam DP-008 rules the roost. A simple line in FROM your iPhone / iPad to the Tascam, and you&#039;ll really be on the road to some SERIOUS mobile recording; not just &quot;doobie doobie doooo!!!&quot;. That&#039;s fine for the singer-songwriter types, but it&#039;s purely doo-doo for glitch and noise-leaning electronic artists.

Plus, Sonoma is releasing a $200 piece of dedicated hardware, just to bestow the privilege of recording line-in with their multi-track software.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you might be missing the point. 

While these multitrack apps certainly offer some comprehensive recording and mixing options, I hardly think anyone is planning to choose them over a dedicated DAW. 

What could be more perfect for using to quickly lay down some quick melodic ideas, such as new back up harmonies for that chorus that just came into your head while driving to work, or putting down an idea for a fresh rhythmic beat with layered tracks of hands and mouth sounds, or just playing around with a rough demo of some guitar parts that work together. 

These apps save you having to be near computers, set up mixers, mics, cables, etc..... You load the app, and you&#039;re ready to get creative. 

Surely that can only be a good thing!?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What I don&#039;t get why electronic musicians have any use for a multi-track apps(4-Track, et al)on Apple devices. I mean, the &quot;line-in&quot; options are SO limited (w/ a few EXPENSIVE solutions on the way), I find apps like 4-Track to be useless. Even w/ AudioCopy / Paste, my brain aches at the prospect of trying to properly sync up loops / tracks from other apps into 4-Track.

It makes sense for the acoustic artist (acoustic guitar / vocals / drum kit), but for someone who is using other apps (or external devices)to create their sound, multi-track apps seem unusable. 

What am I missing, people?]]></description>
