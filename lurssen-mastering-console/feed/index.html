		<description><![CDATA[It is a very useful tool ? for any experienced engineer who even has professional gear as myself and has the correct capability to here what they are doing in a good treated room.
To me as a mastering engineer for twenty years it is another sound or tool I can add to my experience. We use different approaches for different situations when called for.
The only problem I have experienced with it is that there is no exporting option to bring the results back in to your daw or desk etc.. when using the app version to do a final tweaking analysis! The app version can come in handy for those clones who insist on listening in their vehicles for satisfaction. I believe a vehicle is not a very accurate place to consider the final termination for a mix, but I have seen where actuall record contracts were decided by this method. Nevertheless I will say I you tweak the mix in the vehicle with the app and listen back in my room, things actually sound right &#038; balanced &#038; on all other systems, ipod,clock radio, etc.. With out any drastic changes in frequencies. Although I do use a correctional software to look for any dips &#038; peeks that would maybe not be playable on some speakers. As we know a lot of speaker as are just not capable of playing back certain frequencies. This where the upper midrange comes in rather handy!
Hopefully they will have an exporting feature for the app to get the music back into your dad or workstation.<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/263a.png" alt="☺" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>
