<p>The output can be recorded to an audio file which you<br />
can use with other Apps and programs for further processing.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<p>&#8211; Voice control of pitch and timbre<br />
&#8211; 22-channel Vocoder<br />

<blockquote><p>The first app in the world that can separate and transform vocals within any song on your device!</p>
<p>Be amazed as your favorite singers become robots, aliens, monsters, older, younger or the opposite gender, all without affecting their backing tracks! Have fun with your friends! Remix, record and share your transformations as audio or video files, or add them straight to your next live set. The integrated ADX separation technology provides results that are impossible to produce with any other software on the market.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<p>&#8211; Separate and transform any vocal, in any song (mono or stereo)<br />

<p>With time-saving features and a UI designed to get out of your way, this is the app you need for podcasting, radio journalism, or other professional voice production like lectures, speeches, and voiceovers.</p>
<p>— Streamlined Recording —</p>
<p>Open Ferrite and with just one tap you’re recording. No fuss, and it won&#8217;t break a sweat even with hours-long sessions. Just make sure your device has enough free space!</p>
<p>Recording an interview and you want to highlight a few quotes? Have to take out some inappropriate language? Or just fluffed a sentence and need to fix it? Bookmark moments during your recording and they’ll be flagged up during edits, so you can jump right to them.</p>
<p>Monitor levels with live recording meters, or listen through headphones. Tag your audio to find it quickly later. And of course you can import audio from your Music Library, iCloud, and other services such as Dropbox.</p>
<p>Please note: the free version has limited duration for recording &amp; editing projects. Upgrade, and you can edit projects up to 24 hours long!</p>
<p>— Editing is a Snip —</p>
<p>Ferrite features full multi-track editing, from quick cuts, up to producing a complete podcast or broadcast package. Zoom out to see hours at a glance, or zoom in all the way down to individual samples.</p>
<p>Take a single clip, or a bunch, and arrange them in an editing project: moving, cropping, slicing, fading in and out, or crossfade between clips just by overlapping them. Arrange your clips on tracks, with full control over each track’s volume and panning, and Mute or Solo as needed.</p>
<p>And best of all, you needn’t fear trying out changes: Ferrite has great Undo/Redo — even if you quit the app and come back a month later, you can still undo all the way back to the moment you created your project!</p>
<p>— Advanced Editing Features —</p>
<p>Need more? Ferrite also includes:</p>
<p>• Automatic ducking: set tracks to “duck under” others (e.g. ducking music behind voice-overs)<br />
• Strip Silence: Carves away all the silent sections from a recording, making it easy to edit the remaining audio</p>
<p>With a single In-App Purchase, you can unlock these additional tools:</p>
<p>• Add professional effects to your tracks such as Noise Gate and Dynamic Range Compression, for projects that sound clean and engaging<br />
• Automate volume, panning and effects settings so they vary over time, both on individual tracks and the final mix<br />
• Adjust automated settings during playback to record your changes into the timeline<br />
• If you need the most precise control, you can create or fine-tune automation curves directly</p>
<p>— Bonus Features in iOS 9 —</p>
<p>• Find your recordings and projects direct from your Home Screen, with Spotlight support<br />
• iPad Split View and Slide Over support: Use Ferrite side-by-side with other apps. Recording a narration? Open another app with your script and place Ferrite down the side of the screen. Or open the User Guide in Safari on one side while you learn Ferrite on the other.</p>
<p>Bonus features available on compatible devices only. Please see our support pages for more details. Maximum number of tracks available depends on the speed of your device.</p>

(If you are looking to use Colla Voce for whistling or instrumental music, please see the note at the bottom.) See our website at http://www.collavoceapp.com for a demo video, UI Tour, FAQ and articles.</p>
<p>The app is built around two beautifully simple ideas:</p>
<p>1. A playable piano with keys that light up as you sing. If you sing a note in tune, the corresponding key is immediately highlighted in yellow. Sharp and flat notes are coloured green and red, respectively.</p>
<p>2. A recording tool that allows you to capture and play back your own voice, in an interactive, fluid way that is designed around the way you rehearse.</p>
<p>Together, these two ideas produce something that is greater than the sum of its parts. Colla Voce’s exceptionally accurate and responsive pitch detection provides real-time visual feedback on both coarse- and fine-grained singing pitch. However, the ultimate judge of musicality is the human ear, not any computer program! Instant, note-by-note replay lets you go back and hear how you sound “from the outside”. Colla Voce can even automatically play the corresponding piano notes along with the audio replay.</p>
<p>The psychology of singing pitch is subtle and complex. The gap between what you hear and what others hear as you sing can be surprisingly wide. Colla Voce bridges that gap. You could think of it as a mirror for your voice.</p>
<p>Designed with the elegant aesthetics of a real musical instrument, Colla Voce is so intuitive that anybody can pick it up and use it immediately. At the same time, it is sophisticated enough to support musicians at every stage of their musical journey. Beginners taking their first steps, learning to reliably sing back a note; students practising for aural examinations, learning intervals and sight-singing; vocal coaches looking to give their pupils a new perspective on their voices; amateur and professional singers of all kinds polishing their performances; Colla Voce offers something for everyone.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<p>* A playable, 3D piano keyboard with an optional overlay showing the note name for each key.<br />
* As you sing, the corresponding piano keys are highlighted: yellow for in tune, green for sharp, red for flat.<br />
* An innovative, proprietary algorithm, specifically tailored for singing voices, gives accurate and fast pitch detection.<br />
* Sophisticated note tracking logic prevents highlighting of extraneous notes, e.g. intermediate pitches as the voice moves from one note to another.<br />
* Tuning information displayed on the piano keyboard is clear and stable, even in the presence of wide vibrato (where the instantaneous pitch can range over multiple notes).<br />
* Instantaneous pitch is displayed in a graph, so that vibrato/waver contour is visible.<br />
* The graph also acts as an “index” for the replay functionality, allowing the user to identify sung notes by their musical note names.<br />
* One-touch replay of the last 5 seconds, 10 seconds or 20 seconds of recorded sound. Alternatively, stop recording and drag on the fine pitch graph to scroll and select a range from 60 seconds of history (two-finger drag to scroll, single-finger drag to select).<br />
* &#8220;Replay auto-accompany&#8221; causes the piano to automatically play the corresponding piano notes during playback.<br />
* &#8220;Note Lock&#8221; allows you to disable keys corresponding to notes that will not be sung, allowing the note tracker and auto-accompany to avoid those notes.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.promusicapps.tk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/screen480x480-5.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8242" src="https://www.promusicapps.tk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/screen480x480-5-300x225.jpeg" alt="screen480x480 (5)" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.promusicapps.tk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/screen480x480-5-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.promusicapps.tk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/screen480x480-5.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>LoopTree is an exciting new breed of looper that brings more fun than ever to creating live music! Record and group practically unlimited vocal and instrumental loops using a powerful, layered interface that gives you unrivalled control over the music you create.</p>
<p>Get your creative juices flowing and evolve your loops using the built-in filter and multi-touch beat repeat.</p>
<p>http://www.looptreeapp.com/</p>
<p>LoopTree solves the problem of destructive merging by instead combining your loops into layers. You retain individual control over your original loops and you can also control them as one using the new layer.</p>
<p>Note: of course nothing’s truly unlimited, but we haven’t programmed any specific limit to the number of loops or layers you can have. If you keep adding loops, eventually you will start to hear audio glitches.</p>
<p>FEATURE HIGHLIGHTS</p>
<p>• Unlimited number of loops (practically!)<br />
• Non-destructive layering<br />
• Beat repeat &#8211; sample, repeat and reverse loops<br />
• Filter &#8211; add variety with an LPF, BPF and HPF</p>
<p>RECORDING</p>
<p>• Normal recording &#8211; fixed or multiple length loops<br />
• Chained recording &#8211; select multiple tracks to record loops back-to-back<br />
• Layered recording &#8211; equivalent of non-destructive overdubbing</p>
<p>LOOP LENGTH</p>
<p>Within a session, all loops are a 2^n multiple of the shortest loop (2x, 4x, 8x, etc). This makes it really easy to set the loop length whilst recording.</p>
<p>EASY TO USE</p>
<p>• One-finger volume/pan control on individual or simultaneous loops<br />
• Group control &#8211; group tracks into layers; parent tracks control all layers of child tracks.<br />
• MIDI Control<br />
• Quantize options<br />
• Metronome &#8211; create custom accented rhythms</p>
<p>SHARING AND IMPORT</p>
<p>• Support for IAA, AudioBus &#8211; best used with LoopTree in the foreground<br />
• AudioCopy &#8211; copy session recordings and combined loops<br />
• AudioPaste &#8211; start your session with pasted audio<br />
• Share sessions and recordings via email, iTunes and SoundCloud</p>
<p>AUDIO INTERFACES</p>
<p>LoopTree works well with headphones, but for truly outstanding quality, we recommend using a USB audio interface. We have tested the following interfaces:</p>
<p>• Behringer UCA222 and 202<br />
• Focusrite Scarlett 18i8 (includes MIDI)</p>
