<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2015/08/screen480x480-10.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8337" src="https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2015/08/screen480x480-10-300x225.jpeg" alt="screen480x480 (10)" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2015/08/screen480x480-10-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2015/08/screen480x480-10.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>iTONTO the App, documents the Engineering and Design of “TONTO”, The Original New Timbral Orchestra.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: iTONTO is not a functional iOS recreation of TONTO.</p>
<p>TONTO is one of the most important innovations in musical history. TONTO is the first synthesizer of popular music and is displayed and described in great detail within the App. This historic instrument, the invention of Grammy winning Malcolm Cecil, helped influence American cultural and musical history and is one of the most recorded instruments of all time.<br />
The App includes detailed photos of the front and back of each panel with drill down and zoom capabilities, circuitry and schematics, personal comments, hand drawn notes in design, and stories about TONTOS history. Collaborations include Steve Wonder, Billy Preston, Gil Scott Heron, Little Feet, Doobie Brothers, George Harrison and The Isley Brothers. TONTO is on over 160 albums including 2 of Rolling Stone’s top 100 best selling albums of all time.</p>
<p>TONTO – The Original New Timbral Orchestra uses the principle of analog subtractive synthesis to create multi-timbral polyphonic sounds.The heart of a subtractive synthesizer is its filter. TONTO has a compliment of fourteen filters: two full MOOG 904 band-pass filters,<br />
two Arp Low Pass filters,<br />
four Oberhiem SEM filters;<br />
two Cecil/Serge dual filters;<br />
one ARP 1040 multi function filter<br />
and one Cecil Custom low pass filter.<br />
It also has 39 oscillators; 22 envelope generators;<br />
18 VCA’s and many more modules,<br />
including processors, sequencers and controllers which can be patched to create at least fourteen discrete “voices” – each with it’s own unique timbral quality and all of which are able to be controlled simultaneously. As its name implies, it is truly an integrated orchestra of new timbres.<br />
Optimized for iPhone 6, IOS 8.0 or better.</p></blockquote>

We’ve made it the most elegant and powerful way to compose music on a handheld device.</p>
<p>To add a note, select a note length and tap anywhere on the score. Use the built-in keyboard, guitar, or a Core MIDI compatible keyboard to quickly enter notes and chords using step-entry or in real-time recording mode. Using this mode, you can play-in a part with the built-in keyboard to quickly capture a musical idea and have it automatically transcribed onto the score.</p>
<p>If you want to continue an existing project, import a Symphony/Symphony Pro, MusicXML, or MIDI file from your computer or from another app like Mail, DropBox, or Safari.</p>
<p>With Symphony, you can create a wide range of musical elements in your composition, including dynamics and articulations, time and key signature changes, clef changes, repeats, arpeggiated chords, glissandos, tuplets, tempo changes, sustain pedal, similes, and pickup measures. Furthermore, you can also create and edit chord symbols, lyrics, and annotations using the iPhone’s standard keyboard.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re done composing, print out your score, or export your project as an AAC, PDF, MusicXML, MIDI or Symphony file. Share your song with a friend via email or SoundCloud, or send it directly to your computer with iTunes File Sharing.</p>
<p>Feature Highlights:</p>
<p>• 100+ built-in instruments<br />
• Up to 15 instruments, 45 staves, and 4 voices/layers per composition<br />
• Edit using standard music notation, guitar tabs, and percussion notation<br />
• Add or edit notes by tapping on the score or by playing a built-in keyboard, guitar, bass guitar, or a connected Core MIDI instrument (requires Camera Connection Kit or Midi Mobilizer<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> II)<br />
• Record a part in real-time with a built-in instrument or a connected Core MIDI instrument<br />
• Import MusicXML, MIDI, MXL, or Symphony/Symphony Pro projects<br />
• Export as a PDF, MusicXML, MIDI, AAC, or Symphony file<br />
• Multi-track copy/paste<br />
• Edit, view, and play your score in portrait or landscape<br />
• Make any number of tracks invisible to view only the particular staves you want at a given time<br />
• Familiar gestures and convenient shortcuts for navigating menus<br />
• Reorder and reposition staves vertically<br />
• Tons of articulations and dynamics to fine-tune the playback of your composition<br />
• Add grace notes and custom noteheads<br />
• Edit the length or pitch of multiple notes and rests at once using multi-note select<br />
• Delete a note, measure, or an entire selection area at once<br />
• Loop playback between specific measures<br />
• Metronome click during playback and recording, with a customizable volume level<br />
• Undo/Redo almost any editing operation<br />
• In Select Mode, tap on a measure with two fingers to add a time or key signature change, clef change, repeat, alternate ending, or double barline<br />
• Chord symbol, lyric, and annotation tools<br />
• Fully customizable stem directions and beam groups<br />
• Transposing instruments and concert pitch options<br />
• Change the tempo or clef at any point in the score<br />
• Print an entire score from your iPhone with AirPrint<br />
• Stream audio or share your screen wirelessly with AirPlay to compatible speakers, stereo systems, AV receivers, Apple TV, or other devices<br />
• Create your own custom project template or use a built-in one<br />

<p>It&#8217;s great to see that Apple is behind the idea of iOS devices becoming a serious platform for music creation.  I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how this will translate into new music apps created for iOS 7 and beyond, when it becomes available later this year!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This looks like a great tool for composers and arrangers that want an easy straight forward way to try out alternative arrangements when putting songs together.</p>
<blockquote><p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4838" title="omjSQVSWIKENVZt8PPpbq0-temp-upload.tqzzfiho.320x480-75" src="https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/omjSQVSWIKENVZt8PPpbq0-temp-upload.tqzzfiho.320x480-75-208x300.jpg" alt="" width="208" height="300" srcset="https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/omjSQVSWIKENVZt8PPpbq0-temp-upload.tqzzfiho.320x480-75-208x300.jpg 208w, https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2012/05/omjSQVSWIKENVZt8PPpbq0-temp-upload.tqzzfiho.320x480-75.jpg 334w" sizes="(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px" />HyperTunes lets you compose and arrange music based on structure, such as verse-chorus-bridge song form, and it keeps all your musical content at your fingertips as you do so.</p>
<p>It lets you to focus on the big picture as you compose, and makes it much easier to try different arranging options than a traditional sequencer timeline does.</p>
<p>For details, and some videos on how it works, check out out &#8211; <a href="http://hypertunes.net/">http://hypertunes.net/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can start from a song form and then plug in instrument parts later, the way an artist might sketch out a piece before filling in the details.</p>
<p>Or, you can work in an exploratory manner, adding one new section at a time.</p>
<p>You can rearrange the entire song in one step, just by selecting a different form from the extensive built-in menu, or by defining your own unique song form.</p>
<p>Plug instrument parts &#8211; drum grooves, bass lines, guitar licks, keyboad riffs &#8211; into the sections of your song at any time.</p>
<p>Modify the chords/keys of any section at any time. HyperTunes always tranposes the parts of your song to fit the currently associated chords.</p>
<p>But HyperTunes isn&#8217;t just about super-flexible arranging operations. It&#8217;s also about maximizing the accessibility of your content.</p>
<p>It lets you access all your MIDI content in just a few touches, so that you can easily share and reuse content between different songs and libraries.</p>
<p>Import any number of original music projects and third party pattern libraries in General MIDI format.</p>
<p>Export your arrangement as General MIDI for performance or further development using your desktop sequencer or other music making tools.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not sure how useful this app will be in everyday music-making life for most of us, but it did strike me as a novel concept for an app!</p>
<blockquote><p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4525" title="CPqtUMnrxwxItYmllKmZ0M-temp-upload.lrgdiwqt.480x480-75" src="https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/CPqtUMnrxwxItYmllKmZ0M-temp-upload.lrgdiwqt.480x480-75-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/CPqtUMnrxwxItYmllKmZ0M-temp-upload.lrgdiwqt.480x480-75-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2012/04/CPqtUMnrxwxItYmllKmZ0M-temp-upload.lrgdiwqt.480x480-75.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Designed to aid composing your own music prior to punching the paper strips for Music Box&#8217;s, this allows you to compose, preview, play, save and share (via iTunes file transfer) you creations.</p>
<p>&#8211; Add, move, delete notes<br />
&#8211; Disable Notes for temporary changes<br />
&#8211; Multiple undo<br />
&#8211; Ripple edits<br />
&#8211; Save and Load (access the save location via iTunes File Sharing to share your creations with others &#8211; more sharing options planned)<br />
&#8211; Retina display support for the new iPad<br />
&#8211; Sounds sampled from physical Music Box for added reality <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>The physical Music Boxes with the paper punch strips and are great fun &#8211; what I found was missing was an easy way to preview either transpositions or original creations. This aims to fill that gap.</p>
<p>In the works is online Upload/Download for easy sharing, and a layout for smaller work areas ie Universal App support (+iPhone). Please send any bug reports our way so we can shake them out!</p>
<p>Tips:<br />
&#8211; Notes are added/edited in the *Lower* strip only: the middle one is a zoomed view (use it to pan at any time though), the top is an overall view (which you can use to jump your view around, or play through the entire piece by hand).<br />
&#8211; Start with the &#8216;Add&#8217; button, the tap in the lower strip view to set a note. Touch and slide your finger to add a note and adjust where it ends up &#8211; the note is played as you create/change pitch so it&#8217;s easy to get what you need.<br />
&#8211; Use the zoomed in view to see what you are doing (fingers do get in the way)<br />
&#8211; You can use the Add and Move modes together &#8211; it will then only add a note if it doesn&#8217;t find one near where you tap. With &#8216;Add&#8217; only it creates regardless, but with both modes active you can add and adjust easily.<br />
&#8211; Turn off &#8216;Snap&#8217; mode to allow you to place notes between the vertical bars.<br />
&#8211; The select mode allows you to swipe across an area to select, as well as simply being able to tap to select/deselect.</p>
<p>Be aware that the physical Music Boxes don&#8217;t allow the same note twice without a gap of one vertical line: currently Music Box Composer does not show this limitation of the physical Music Boxes, a future version will.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While I&#8217;m sure many of you have been enjoying a <strong>chilled out start to the year</strong> (particularly if it&#8217;s winter in your neck of the woods), however it has been anything but relaxed here at Promusiapps HQ, due to work, travel, and other comittments.</p>
<p>But as things finally start looking like they are settling down now, we can <strong>get back to the main business at hand</strong>, and that is bringing you the latest news on all things music and audio in the iOS app world. If you&#8217;ve been with us for a while now, you&#8217;ll know we aim to provide you with a central online destination for all the latest news and information as we get it directly from music app developers and makers of audio and MIDI hardware devices.</p>
<p>This year we plan to continue to doing that, but we&#8217;d also like to <strong>get feedback</strong> on what other things you&#8217;d like to see on the site. So feel free to drop us a line on the contacts page with your thoughts and suggestions.</p>
<p>So again, <strong>sorry for the sluggish start</strong> to the year, but all hands are back on deck and we&#8217;re looking forward to another exciting year of new products and software to keep your creative musical juices flowing freely.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Mikers</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_0075.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2809" title="IMG_0075" src="https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_0075-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_0075-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_0075.jpg 384w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a>While dedicated eBook readers still haven’t yet reached the lofty heights in popularity as the multipurpose iPad and its extended family of apps, the iPad is a highly capable eBook reader in itself, with thousands of best sellers, education, and entertainment titles available to download.</p>
<p>Helping serve the needs of electronic musicians, Anthem Publishing, who handle MusicTech magazine, have been busy producing iOS friendly versions of their special Music Tech Focus issues.</p>
<p>With more than a dozen releases already, each issue is a perfectly digitised version of the 132 page magazine. The aim of each issue to is focus on one particular software package such as Reason and Ableton Live, or an area of music recording, such as Mixing and Mastering.</p>
<p>Like the magazine, the iOS app features workshops, tutorials, software and hardware reviews, and expert tricks and tips, ALL specific to the music software or recording technique.</p>
<p>Of course, one of the immediate benefits of these apps, is being able to carry around any number of issue of Music Tech Focus either on your iPad /iPhone/iPod Touch, and fire them up in a flash.</p>
<p>We’ve been using an iPad to check out the Ableton Live 8, Logic Pro 9, and Mixing editions over the last few weeks, and it’s a real convenience having them right there, rather than having to dig around for the magazines.</p>
<p>The apps work in portrait or landscape view. The difference being, in landscape view you see two pages at a time, and with the iPad upright, you see one page in a larger scale.</p>
<p>Like a real magazine, flipping the pages, via the iPad, offers an animation of the page turning, which could probably be a little faster for my liking, but it’s a cool effect anyway.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_0073.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2810" title="IMG_0073" src="https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_0073-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_0073-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_0073.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Double tapping the display zooms into the area of the page you tap, and can then be dragged around, or double tapped to return to full page view. Pinching the page in and out also does the same thing.</p>
<p>Where these digital versions come into their own, is being able to quickly and easily bring up thumb nails of the pages, as well as a main index offering main features, and then to go to a specific page instantly. And naturally it’s possible to ‘add’ and view saved bookmarks of pages you want to visit regularly. This is really the killer feature of any eBook.</p>
<p>I haven’t tried any issues on a smaller screen, but I dare say it’s not nearly the pleasant experience of the iPad screen, which the issues look super crisp and sharp, even when zooming into the pages.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_0069.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2811" title="IMG_0069" src="https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_0069-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_0069-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_0069.jpg 384w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a>At US$9.99 per issue, these apps are certainly cheaper than the real magazine (and so they should be), although I know some of us find great value in the BONUS DVD of Software/Audio goodies that also come stuck to the front of the magazine. Maybe in the future, they can even look at a way of offering a discount on the app for those that buy the magazine, mainly for the DVD.</p>
<p>While the type of content on offer here isn’t nearly as interactive or fully featured as say The Daily, or even Wired magazine iPad apps, they  still serve a purpose for those that warm to the idea of carrying around digital versions of magazines they are likely to use on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Check out the growing collection of Music Tech Focus apps in the App Store.</p>
