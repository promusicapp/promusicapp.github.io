				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9127" src="https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sc552x414-3-300x225.jpeg" alt="sc552x414 (3)" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sc552x414-3-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sc552x414-3.jpeg 552w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Berlin based music software ninjas, Sugar Bytes have ported yet another of their delicious desktop computer synths to iOS, with both an iPhone and iPad version of Unique now available in the App Store.</p>
<p>Fans of the company’s back catalogue of highly original music making software, will know this isn’t exactly a new product, in the sense that the desktop version has been out for a number of years. The converted of us will also know that, compared to most of Sugar Bytes’ other offerings, this is much more conventional in design and operation. And that’s not a bad thing either.</p>
<p>Since Unique has been available for desktop users for quite some time now, there is already a wealth of information, videos, and reviews covering its features readily available online. But for those discovering it for the first time, and also as it&#8217;s debuting on iOS, here’s the key features.</p>
<p>At its core, you get a classic, familiar sounding analogue synth, warm enough to funk up any 80s inspired disco track, right through to some of the grittiest grim bass sounds I’ve ever heard…. And that’s just trawling though the 300 odd presets that are included.</p>
<p>When you’re ready to jump in and get your hand dirty with your own sound design, Unique offers 2 oscillators featuring 5 configurable waveforms, 2 effects engines with 5 settings, as well as mix and master sections for getting the sound just right. However, the synth’s most entertaining feature for me at least (and many others I expect), is its Vowel Filter which presents users with some truly ‘unique’ sound mincing options. This creative section serves up familiar high/low pass filters, configurable trigger options, and up to four playable vowel formants at once.</p>
<p>Last but not least is Unique’s control section, featuring an LFO with configurable triggering options, a recordable motion ‘X/Y’ pad which is also configurable (of course), and not forgetting the 8-step duophonic arpeggiator.</p>
<p>The move to iOS, as expected, means Unique plays nicely with a host of other music making apps and controllers, thanks to its support for MIDI learn and automation, as well as AudioBus and Inter-App Audio, plus it even supports Ableton Link Kit.</p>
<p>At just 30Mb in file size, and half that figure to purchase for iPad (even less for the iPhone version), Unique is a worthy addition to your iOS synth collection. The top notch library of sounds aside, the user interface is inviting and logically laid out, and this beast of a synth is simply pleasant to drive.</p>

<p>A music hacker&#8217;s paradise, Analogkit is designed to be enjoyed by both seasoned synth aficionados and curious cable-wranglers. Whether you&#8217;re into built-from-scratch effects pedals, synths, vocoders or even DIY games, AnalogKit allows you to build nearly anything you can dream of.</p>
<p>• Piece together controls, effects and signal generators into any gear you can imagine.<br />
• 50+ included core components that can be combined to create endless possibilities of sounds.<br />
• Share your creations with the community via the built-in Swap Meet, or browse, live-preview, and download gear built by other users.<br />
• Compatible with many external audio interfaces so you can run AnalogKit as an effects board for mics, guitars, and other analog instruments.<br />
• Full USB, Bluetooth, and WiFi MIDI support to let you use your favorite external controllers<br />
• Advanced optimization algorithms enable you to run tens of thousands of basic modules in real-time on a modern iPad.<br />
• State of the art anti-aliased oscillators provide the most authentic sound sources digital synthesis can offer.<br />
• All the favorite toys from modular analog synths as well as digit logic components so you can build all the hybrid franken-synths your hardware modular friends could only dream of.</p>
<p>Under the hood, AnalogKit is anything but a toy. The process of putting things together with Analogkit is nothing less than an exploration of digital audio creation that&#8217;s both revealing and powerful.</p>
<p>Like a supercharged electronics project kit, Analogkit lets you combine and wire things up in any way you want, rather than having to settle for adjusting settings on existing gear. Depending on what components you choose, it can be both a trippy generative app that&#8217;s easy to lose hours with, or nimble and precise tool for building custom setups quickly.</p>
<p>Analogkit takes full advantage of its digital nature and lets you literally hook anything into anything, chain together as many of a thing as you like, and finally experiment like a kid again &#8230;a kid that happens to have the best audio toy to come to the iPad yet.</p>

The low frequency, speaker popping, bass synth, Cyclop, is the latest arrival for iPad.</p>
<p>At its core, Cyclop for iPad is pound for pound a replica of its older brother for desktop pcs, released a few years back. It’s a monophonic bass synth, meaning only one note is playable at a time, and although gritty basslines are not the sole function for this synth engine, that’s definitely where it’s subby pounding heart is at.</p>
<p>The Cyclop plug-in has already seen plenty of coverage since it was first released, such as the great overview by the soundtestroom <a href="http://thesoundtestroom.com/cyclop-by-sugar-bytes-ipad-edition-demo-and-tour/" target="_blank">here</a>, so I’m not going to delve too much into the inner workings, for the sake of repeating what has already been reported and reviewed elsewhere online.</p>
<p>But at the very least, for those that still aren’t too sure what Cyclop is, here’s a brief overview of the key features.</p>
<p>At the top left of the app, is the first of four unique dials, the wobble knob, which is a controllable parameter allowing Cyclop to generate complex LFO modulations. Of the 12 available slots here, up to 16 different waveforms can be selected, one in each slot.</p>
<p>At the bottom left side are the two main sound makers, which are both packed with 6 synth engines each, including Saw Regiment, Analog Sync, FM, Transformer, Spectromat, and Phase Stressor. Further tweaking of each synth can be made with a series of colourfully labelled knobs such as Syncfreak, Stab, and Digitize. My favourite it the transformer synth, which is combo of a granular synth and wavetable synth, which has some cool vocal samples you can mess around with.</p>
<p>On the opposite side, also at the bottom of the screen, are two filters and a routing section. The router can send the two synths to independent filters, or plus there’s parallel or series mode. There are 10 filter types to choose from, plus the usual cutoff, resonance, and wet/dry mix controls. A unique feature in the filter section is the ‘vowel’ option, which can give bass sounds that ‘mouthing’ style bass effect.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2015/07/screen480x480-2.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8220" src="https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2015/07/screen480x480-2-300x225.jpeg" alt="screen480x480 (2)" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2015/07/screen480x480-2-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2015/07/screen480x480-2.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Another key sound shaping component is the distortion knob next to the sub-oscillator, with its 9 different modes, which can really drive new character into a sound. Playing with the sub-osc and bass controls let you dial in additional lows, and the stereo knob, as it sounds, adds a widening effect.</p>
<p>Naturally, modulation is the main drawcard of Cyclop, and the centre of the screen offers access to a customisable envelop, LFO and step sequencer as sources for synths and filters. The same area is where you assign modulation targets for the wobble and sound knobs.</p>
<p>For anyone already familiar with Sugar Bytes previous products, you’ll know they excel at pattern-based effects sequencing, check out <a href="https://www.promusicapps.tk//mini-review-effectrix/">Effectrix</a> if you need a refresher. So they’ve been kind enough to pack this same functionality into Cyclop. The dial in the top right corner, in combination with the effects sequencer section in the middle of the screen, allow you to add a variety of programmable effects, ranging from phasing, chorus and looping, to vinyl effects and classic delays and reverbs.</p>
<p>And like all of the key knobs and parameters in Cyclop, these can all be automated for finite control over your sound.</p>
<p>As I said, this was merely a brief overview of the key features of Cyclops, and I haven’t even touched on the excellent preset browser and the cool arcade game style patch preview option.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2015/07/screen480x480-1.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8221" src="https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2015/07/screen480x480-1-300x225.jpeg" alt="screen480x480 (1)" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2015/07/screen480x480-1-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.promusicapps.tk//wp-content/uploads/2015/07/screen480x480-1.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Most importantly for iOS users are the features that have been included with the iPad version of Cyclop. These include a wonderfully slick touch user interface, and  full MIDI support for using external controllers. You can also access audio from your devices music library. iTunes File sharing is available for importing/exporting files, and last but not least the all important Inter-App Audio and Audiobus support for talking with other music making/recording apps.</p>
<p>If a bass line is serious business for you, from cranking EDM to gritty dubstep, there isn&#8217;t a better iPad app for creating truly original, sub-ulicious sounds, with almost limitless possibilities, that Cyclop.</p>

<p>For this new App we&#8217;ve taken iJingle PRO as the basis and added extensive PLAYLIST and SHOW PLANNING capabilities, creating iJingle WebCaster, to be used by Broadcasters, Podcasters and Live Sound Engineers.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re On-air or engineer Live sound&#8230;</p>
<p>iJingle WebCaster is a soundboard style jingle player, great for any type of on-air or live situation. The extensive arranger and playlist creation features allow you to prepare parts of your show in advance or even create them on the fly. Select them from the preset bar and press play, pause or skip ahead.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re preparing a Show or Podcast&#8230;</p>
<p>iJingle WebCaster&#8217;s Show Planning allows you to pre-plan your Show or Podcast in great detail. Use the arranger to set the total time for your show, add music items (jingle, fx and/or intro music) and non-music items (presentation, interview, etc.). When you&#8217;re ready to record your show, just push play and off you go. The time line informs you about what&#8217;s playing, what&#8217;s coming and even shows you documents and websites you&#8217;ve linked to show items, right on the main screen.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re pre-recording a radio show or podcast&#8230;</p>
<p>iJingle WebCaster has voice-tracking. This means that you can create a complete show, right on your iPad. Plan your show by adding audio elements to the arranger and then record your voice on the segments you need. Easily edit your voice bits and tweak the arrangement and save the whole show as one file, ready to be distributed.</p>

* With just a few clicks, convert any .mid file in a basic General MIDI format into a Yamaha-like style, and play along with it live, sounding just like your favorite band.</p>
<p>Besides the iPad, iPhone or iPod, the MidiXpress app also requires a General MIDI-compatible piano keyboard for playing melody and changing chords, and a hardware or software synthesizer for converting MIDI into sound. Usually both requirements can be satisfied by a traditional music synthesizer keyboard with MIDI In/Out capabilities. If the synthesizer cannot be connected to the Pad, iPhone or iPod directly, a Mac computer with its Audio MIDI Setup application may be used as an intermediary.</p>
<p>The MidiXpress app replicates and expands on the auto-accompaniment feature of common musical keyboards by playing Intro/Verse/Chorus/Fill In/Ending loops from widely available Yamaha style (.sty) files or any .mid file over a MIDI interface. It establishes a two-way CoreMIDI connection between the iPhone/iPad and your synthesizer, analyzes chords played with your left hand, and sends the style&#8217;s accompaniment in the key of the chord back to the synthesizer. At the same time, the melody/voice part played with your right hand is passed unchanged through the app.</p>
