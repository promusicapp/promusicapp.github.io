Rubix is designed to offer a perfectly balanced combination of high-fidelity sound, solid build quality, compact size, affordable price, and crucial features for today&#8217;s musicians and producers.</p>
<p>The new audio interface line consists of the Rubix 22, 24 and 44. Each multi-platform interface is carefully engineered to have extremely low noise from input to output.  Clean, detailed sound is the top priority, with transparent, low noise mic preamps and support for audio resolutions up to 24-bit/192kHz. Highly visible indicators clearly show the presence of a good signal or an overloading input, even from a distance. Extensive shielding and ground lifts help ensure clean, quiet operation in a variety of venues, and the compact metal construction means Rubix can provide studio-grade performance just about anywhere.</p>

<p>Compact, portable, and easy to use, GO:MIXER makes it simple to record high-quality audio in music videos and other video content created with your smartphone. Just plug in GO:MIXER to capture a pristine stereo soundtrack* directly to your video as you perform. With multiple inputs available, you can connect a mic, musical instruments, and media players and mix them all together live while you shoot. Instead of relying on your phone’s noisy mono mic or recording external audio tracks that you have to sync later in a video editor, you can now record top-quality audio in one quick and easy step. GO:MIXER is the ideal solution for adding a pro sound touch to your social media videos, helping you get more views and attract more followers!</p>

<div align="center"><em>The Lightpad Block</em></div>
<div></div>
<div>Renowned artists including Grimes, Steve Aoki, and RZA are already making music on BLOCKS and creating signature soundpacks for BLOCKS musicians. Grimes &#8211; a composer, producer, and global superstar whose sound is redefining pop music &#8211; said, &#8220;ROLI BLOCKS will democratize music production. It&#8217;s so intuitive and versatile. I&#8217;m always on the go, and BLOCKS is the most powerful mobile production tool I&#8217;ve ever used.&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Three Blocks launch today. The Lightpad Block features a tactile, glowing surface that lets people shape music through presses, glides, and other natural gestures. The Live Block and Loop Block have controls that make it even easier to perform and produce in real time. BLOCKS is powered by NOISE, a free music app for iPhone and iPad that is now available at the App Store. NOISE connects to BLOCKS wirelessly over Bluetooth, becoming the system&#8217;s sound engine as well as a standalone app.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Roland Lamb, founder and CEO of ROLI, and inventor of BLOCKS, said, &#8220;Many areas of life have been transformed by the digital. Music, though, remains a universal language that everyone understands, but only a few can speak. BLOCKS will change that, and enable people around the world to experience the joy of music-making for the first time.&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Lightpad Block, Live Block, and Loop Block are exclusively available at ROLI.com, Apple.com, and Apple Stores around the world. With a Lightpad Block retailing at $179 (£169.95) and the Live Block and Loop Block at $79 (£69.95), BLOCKS is extraordinarily affordable as well as powerful.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As  many of you know it&#8217;s NAMM season so there is plenty of new audio related products being showcased and announced at the moment. One that caught my eye was these new wireless mixers from Mackie&#8230;.</p>
<p>Mackie&#8217;s press release follows:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.promusicapps.tk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/26501_713.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8593" src="https://www.promusicapps.tk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/26501_713-300x79.jpg" alt="26501_713" width="300" height="79" srcset="https://www.promusicapps.tk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/26501_713-300x79.jpg 300w, https://www.promusicapps.tk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/26501_713.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>ProDX Series mixers couple the power of digital mixing and an ultra-compact form factor perfect for solo performers, small bands, venues and commercial applications that require lower channel counts. Both mixers are equipped with Mackie&#8217;s Wide-Z<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> mic preamps. These combo inputs allow connection of mic, line and instruments and require no gain adjustment for easy setup. And with their single knob hardware design, any user can make quick and easy level adjustments. Using the companion MixerConnect<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> control app, users unlock powerful processing and total wireless control plus the ability to wirelessly play back music or backing tracks from any Bluetooth® capable device.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Performers, small venues and commercial applications often have to settle for limited capability when choosing a compact mixer,&#8221; </em>commented Ben Olswang, Mackie Senior Product Manager. <em>&#8220;With ProDX, we&#8217;ve delivered a powerful digital mixer with loads of processing, wireless control and Bluetooth streaming. But we&#8217;ve also created a mixer that incredibly convenient and easy to use from the intuitive from panel interface. It&#8217;s the perfect combination.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>ProDX mixers have built-in hardware that allows easy control over any channel and output via a single knob. This is perfect for applications such as restaurants, commercial applications, rehearsal studios that have many users that only need quick level adjustment with virtually no learning curve and often in dimly lit or tight spaces.</p>
<p>In addition to the quick front panel hardware, ProDX mixers provide complete wireless control over everything from EQ and FX to voicing and mix presets using the MixerConnect app available for iOS and Android<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> devices. This allows the mixer to be stored safely and out of sight without losing any control. Performers can attach their phone to their mic stand for fast changes to their mix without interrupting the performance to run to the mixer. Both models feature an integrated control bridge, offering a convenient place to set a phone or tablet at just the right angle for keeping an eye on the mix.</p>
<p>ProDX mixers provide the essential tools users need to dial in a great mix. Easy-to-use 3-band EQ w/ sweepable mid, low cut and no-hassle compression per channel delivers pro sound with zero fuss. The built-in ReadyFX<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> effects engine offers a choice of 16 great-sounding effects, so users can pick the perfect delay for their guitar or apply reverb to add life to any vocal application.  A flexible graphic EQ on all outputs allows fine tuning of the overall mix. Users can save their mix and and instantly recall at the next show for quick setup.</p>
<p>In addition to the convenient hardware controls, powerful processing and wireless control, ProDX mixers are equipped with the essential I/O that typical small mixer applications require. The ProDX4 features two Wide-Z preamps, plus TRS main outs and an aux send for sending audio to a monitor or separate zone. The ProDX8 extends the input count to 6 mic preamps and the addition of a second aux send. Both mixers also come with a 1/8&#8243; stereo aux input for connecting a media player and a headphone output for monitoring or silent practice.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;We are excited to bring this incredibly versatile, compact mixing solution to users,&#8221;</em> Olswang commented.<em>&#8220;ProDX was designed to deliver a powerful digital mixer with the ease of use of an analog mixer, all at an incredible price, perfect for solo performers, small bands and commercial applications.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>Pricing and Availability:</strong><br />
The Mackie ProDX4 and ProDX will be available worldwide beginning April, 2016.</p>
<p>ProDX4 has a U.S. MSRP of $259.99 and the ProDX8 will has a U.S. MSRP of $389.99.</p>

To top it all off, it&#8217;s also truly self-powered via 2 AA batteries and comes with an array of additional powering options. No other studio-quality audio interface offers this level of portability at such an affordable price. And, most remarkably, it manages to fit all of these features (and more) into an extremely compact enclosure that fits easily into the palm of a hand. With iRig Pro DUO, true mobility for portable simultaneous 2-channel recording and processing has finally arrived for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>True mobility</strong><br />
What makes iRig Pro DUO stand out in the crowded interface market is its remarkable level of portability and professional audio quality.

<p>With HUE &amp; MIDI you combine your Philips Hue with a little crazy music making. Use the internal old school synth sound or connect your favorite Bluetooth midi apps for some real sounds from your VSTs. Integrating a Philips Hue adds some entertaining possibilities on top, because HUE &amp; MIDI also receives midi data from other devices to send the tones to your lights.</p>
<p>features<br />
&#8211; multitouch piano style keyboard<br />
&#8211; integrated webaudio synth sound<br />
&#8211; supports Midi over Bluetooth (to connect to BLE compatible music apps)<br />
&#8211; supports Philips hue for additional fun while playing</p>
<p>inApps<br />
&#8211; disable iAd</p>
<p>todos for the future<br />
&#8211; improve everything<br />
&#8211; more keyboard options<br />
&#8211; more audio options<br />
&#8211; more light effects<br />
&#8211; more ?</p>
<p>bugs<br />
&#8211; not too many I hope<br />
&#8211; sometimes sound is routed to your headphone plug instead of speakers<br />
&#8211; Midi over Bluetooth is a new technology so there might be bugs in HUE &amp; MIDI and also compatible apps.</p>
<p>tips<br />
&#8211; runs better on new devices<br />
&#8211; search the app store for &#8220;Bluetooth Midi&#8221; or &#8220;BLE Midi&#8221; to find compatible music apps like sequencers and DAWs to experiment with them and your Hue.</p></blockquote>

All four members of the new MOTIV range are Apple MFi (made for iPhone, iPod, or iPad) certified devices, including three condenser models (the MV5, MV88 stereo model, and MV51 large-diaphragm model) and a sleek digital audio interface (MVi) that can connect directly to any iOS device without additional adapters or connection kits. For in-depth control, there&#8217;s also the free ShurePlus<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> MOTIV Mobile Recording iOS app.</p>
<p>The microphones and interface come with five user-selectable DSP modes — Speech, Singing, Flat, Acoustic Instrument, and Loud — designed to help entry-level users seeking better audio quality, and which set audio parameters on the different models behind the scenes, including gain, EQ, and compression.</p>
<p>“The design of the MOTIV range acknowledges respected Shure products of the past, while offering the latest in modern technology and connectivity,” comments Shure Senior Product Manager Wolfgang Bilz. “The MOTIV range was conceived to offer everyone the means to record high-quality sound directly onto mobile and USB devices. With their advanced sound quality, durable construction, powerful DSP and flexible operation, they continue the high standards for which Shure is known.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.promusicapps.tk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/iphone-61.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7684" src="https://www.promusicapps.tk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/iphone-61-300x207.jpg" alt="iphone-61" width="300" height="207" srcset="https://www.promusicapps.tk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/iphone-61-300x207.jpg 300w, https://www.promusicapps.tk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/iphone-61.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>If you could bottle and sell the ‘anticipation’ of the world’s legions of Apple fan prior to each new iPhone release, you’d be one wealthy SOB. It never fails to amuse and amaze me, just how much build up there is. And I say to myself every year, I’m not going to buy into all the leaked pre-release videos and blurry images that appear online before the official product is unveiled, but I end up scouring all the apple news related sites for all the latest news and images nonetheless.</p>
<p>Well the big day arrived this September (as it does most years), and we now have not one, but two new flagship iPhones, the 6 and the 6 Plus. And it without a doubt, Apple has answered many of the questions fans have been hoping for leading up to the launch of Apples redesigned iPhones.</p>
<p>Both new models share most of the same key features, such as being powered by the new A8 2<sup>nd</sup> gen processor, which is dual core 64 bit and clocks in at 1.4GHz, plus you get the M8 motion coprocessor. There is also 1GB of RAM. They both feature a thinner, more rounded form factor and include a sleek glass front the curves to meet the rounded body. I’ve personally been longing for this shape to return since the iPhone 3.  They just feel more comfortable and natural in the hand.</p>
<p>So while both phones perform virtually the same, the overall size of them is the main difference. The display on the 6 is  4.7 inches, and the 6 Plus offers a huge 5.5 inches, and the later also delivers 1920-by-1080 which is full HD visual specs. Naturally, the 6 Plus is wider, longer, and heavier too. Rather than bore you with any more specs, they’re all available here <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-6/specs">https://www.apple.com/iphone-6/specs</a>.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind I went from my everyday phone, an iPhone 4S, straight to reviewing these two, the change was dramatic, to say the least. I&#8217;ve got friends with the iPhone 5, but that model for some reason just didn’t appeal to me personally, so I skipped that whole generation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.promusicapps.tk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Iphone-6-synth.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-7685" src="https://www.promusicapps.tk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Iphone-6-synth-300x276.jpg" alt="Iphone 6 synth" width="209" height="192" srcset="https://www.promusicapps.tk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Iphone-6-synth-300x276.jpg 300w, https://www.promusicapps.tk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Iphone-6-synth-1024x944.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 209px) 100vw, 209px" /></a>Even though I had both phones to review at the same time, I felt it would be sensible to ‘live’ with the iPhone 6, before even taking the 6 Plus out of the box. From day one with the 6, I knew I was going to love these new phones. From the more responsive OS (yes I kept iOS 6.4 on my 4S), to the jump from 3G to 4G, impressive battery life, and crisp screen resolution, the changes were momentous in almost every way. The 6 feels extremely thin next to my 4S, which isn’t surprising given the physical specs, but together with the curved form factor it is real improvement is design.</p>
<p>When I finally pulled the 6 Plus out of the box, after a month with the 6, it did initially feel a little cumbersome, but honestly, within a few days, it’s larger dimensions and added weight weren’t an issue, and I preferred it over the 6. The larger display, enhanced camera, and added battery life were some of contributing factors in this. I can however see how this model may not suit all users, perhaps females with small hands, and I won’t lie it won’t fit comfortably in every pocket/purse/bra, so lugging it around for some might be a chore.</p>
<p>Input/Output wise, both models feature the now standard lightening adaptor on the bottom along for charging/syncing, along with the headphone port and a mono speaker. The left hand side of the handset has the familiar volume controls and the mute button, which I personally get heaps of use out of, and hope they never remove it. The biggest change to the design has seen the sleep/wake switch relocated from the top to the right hand edge, just above the sim card slot. For many iPhone users, including myself, this takes some getting used to.</p>
<p>Some small, but useful, software features appear on the 6 Plus that it’s smaller brother doesn&#8217;t have including a landscape mode, but they aren’t deal breakers. And until developers start to take advantage of this landscape mode, the form factors are the main reason you would go for one over the other.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.promusicapps.tk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Iphone-6-drums.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-7686" src="https://www.promusicapps.tk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Iphone-6-drums-287x300.jpg" alt="Iphone 6 drums" width="187" height="195" srcset="https://www.promusicapps.tk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Iphone-6-drums-287x300.jpg 287w, https://www.promusicapps.tk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Iphone-6-drums-979x1024.jpg 979w, https://www.promusicapps.tk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Iphone-6-drums.jpg 1554w" sizes="(max-width: 187px) 100vw, 187px" /></a>So how do these new models fit into the existing iOS music making eco-system? As you can see from the images I’ve taken of the 6 and 6 Plus side-by-side, the clear winner for any touch-based app is having a bigger display to play with, whether it for easier access to keys on a synth, or tweaking knobs on a virtual guitar amp. There is always going to be a trade-off between something that is extremely portable but perhaps not as easy to operate, then something in the tablet domain that is not as pocket friendly but is far easier to perform on. While both the 6 and the 6 Plus offer more screen real estate over earlier iPhone models, it comes down to each user’s personal needs and desired experience. For example, if and when inspiration strikes and you just have to put an idea down right there and then, you’re more likely to have your phone within reach, than a tablet. As I mentioned, after spending the first few days with the 6 Plus, the added size wasn&#8217;t even a concern. I&#8217;d pick up the 6 every now and then, and compare the two in both of my hands, and didn&#8217;t at any point feel the desire to want to go back to the 6.</p>
<p>One other thing important to note, while the 6 Plus is certainly entering tablet size territory, it doesn’t run iPad apps, and there is a boot load of killer music apps that are still only iPad exclusive.</p>
<p>So for the win, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus offer more screen real estate than previous iPhones, they offer improved processing power, longer battery life and obviously run the latest version of iOS, 8. It was no surprise to see existing music apps load faster, and show no signs of lag (unlike my aging 4S). What I’m really waiting for now, is the next wave of new music apps that truly take advantage of these enhanced features and power, so I can finally discard my 4S to my historic desk draw of outdated tech. (Actually that&#8217;s a lie, I&#8217;ve since ordered a 6 Plus for myself, as I couldn&#8217;t bare the thought of going back to what looked like a toy phone in comparison)</p>
<p>The latest iPhones, like all the previous models, are available to buy outright from Apple and authorised 3rd party retailers, or as part of a 1 or 2 year contract with the provider of your choice.<a href="https://www.promusicapps.tk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Iphone-6-guitar.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-7687" src="https://www.promusicapps.tk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Iphone-6-guitar-300x268.jpg" alt="Iphone 6 guitar" width="216" height="193" srcset="https://www.promusicapps.tk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Iphone-6-guitar-300x268.jpg 300w, https://www.promusicapps.tk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Iphone-6-guitar-1024x916.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 216px) 100vw, 216px" /></a></p>
