		<description><![CDATA[@Reaally,
I&#039;ve just stumbled upon all these comments, I had no idea of their existence until now, and being a DrumsLive developer in close contact with all the guys at the development/marketing team I can assure you we aren&#039;t the source of such comments. Also, I reckon that would really be an unrealistically unprofessional move by our side, in contrast to what we have always professionally communicated through our official channels.
All the best to you and this community,
Fabio]]></description>
